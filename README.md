# Real Asset Size

This is a simple asset that shows you the size in units / meters of meshes and sprites. I made it because I wanted to be able to see the size of a car, house and person without having to go back into the modelling program, or to talk to the artist (if I didn't make it myself). This asset simply shows you it's actual size without messing with it's scale (it remains 1,1,1 to not mess with physics).

To install this, simply just drop the "Real Asset Size" folder into your Unity project. This works all the way from Unity 3.4 to Unity 2020 (and most likely beyond).

Alternatively, you can download it from the Unity Asset Store here: <link>
